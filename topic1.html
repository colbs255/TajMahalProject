        <p>Some people want to learn how to code, but don't have the patience to learn, others have no idea where to start. If you fall into one of these categories (I hope you do, why else would you be on this site?), then this is the place for you. I learned how to program my senior year of high school with tutorials online. While it was a rewarding experience, it was frustrating because many tutorials do not explain concepts in a way that people who have not programmed before can understand, and they do not teach you effecient styles of coding. I created this website with my frustrating programming experiences in mind to teach you how to program in the most effecient, comprehensive way.</p>
    
        <p>It depends on what you want to do. Many people say either Python or Java are the best languages to start with. Python is a very easy language to pick up and has many cool features, but I would recommend starting with Java. Why? Java can run on just about any machine (android apps use java), has fast performance speeds (big companies use Java), and is great for introducing object oriented programming (OOP). Also, once you learn Java, Python will be a walk in the park to learn, whereas going from Python to Java can be relatively frustrating. If you want to do webdesign, then you'll have to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All three of these work together to create beautiful, interactive webpages like the one you see right now. You have to use all three of them to make a good website, so start with HTML, learn some CSS then finish it off with javascript if you want to learn webdesign. Click on the tabs below to read more about each language and see all the different lessons. </p>

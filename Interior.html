        <p>With regards to the interior, the burial chamber has the footprint of an octagon<sup>1</sup>. This creates eight different axes of symmetry, allowing for entrances from many different directions. This geometrical property is also useful because it creates more surface area on the walls for the wall decorations and archways. If one looked at the floor closely, he or she would see that is composed of only 2 shapes that are juxtaposed together. One of which is a 16-sided shape that looks like 2 squares were stacked on top of each other and one was turned 45 degrees, and the other looks like a cross with sections of the ends cut off, making them quite pointy. It is very interesting how the designers were able to create these 2 shapes and fit them together in such a way that they can cover a large floor uniformly like this. These tessellation patterns are also useful because they are capable of evenly fitting inside of their octagonal perimeter. If the floors were overlaid with only square tiles for example, part of the perimeter tiles would have to be cut off in a way that is not as aesthetically pleasing, and it would have been harder to construct the floor with squares. </p>
    
        <p>Additionally, the cenotaphs are covered in different flower designs. Many of which are symmetric with respect to the y axis. Because they are symmetrical in this way, it is easy to evenly space the flowers from left to right, if they weren’t then some of the flowers would look closer together than others, making them looked jumbled together. The chamber also repeats the octagonal theme of the temple once again with its eight sided jali cut from marble<sup>2</sup>. Its placement in the center both strengthens the radial symmetry of the temple and creates a multiaxial barrier for the cenotaphs. This barrier makes the cenotaphs more sacred and directs the visitors to the center.</p>
        
        <p>The overall Taj Mahal complex does not only focus on straight-edged, polygon designs, it also has many circular designs as well. The planners did this intentionally to geometrically complement the polygon themes of the complex. For example, the ceiling of the mosque has a large number of spirals that taken as a whole create many axes of symmetry like a flower from nature that was perfected symmetrically. It is really amazing how this design was implemented so many years ago. The level of craftsmanship is essentially perfect to the human eye, and is amazing even by today’s standards. A technique called incised painting was used to decorate the ceilings. In this process, channels are scratched into the stone, and then a thick paint or stucco plaster is laid across the surface, the material is then scraped off the stone, leaving the paint in the original channel<sup>3: New World</sup>. The many axes of symmetry in the design also creates a sense of something radiating out in many directions, possibly the power of the emperor or their religion.</p>
        
        <p>A common feature of this form of architecture, a jali, is present in many different places inside of the buildings<sup>4</sup>. These use geometric properties to create both beauty and function. The intricate shapes within the jali allow air and some light to come into the building, but they simultaneously hinder some light, preventing the light from hurting the eyes of those looking outside of the building. The jali in this example has several different types of pane designs and contain a plethora of shapes. The central pane contains the star shapes that are very similar to the ones inside of the burial chamber. These panes also exhibit pentagons, which adds a new geometric shape to the array of polygons that this work exhibits. This jali is also symmetric with respect to the vertical axis like many other features of the work. It is also interesting how the designers chose to implement different designs in each pane of this jali rather than maintain a consistent design in all of the panes. This may have been done because several master craftsmen worked on the building, so they probably had different ideas and created a way for them all to implement their ideas. This is interesting because this one jali could possibly represent the different ideas of the architects and designers through the geometry itself.</p>
